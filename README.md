randomnumber
============

Symfony based site for generating random numbers.

Here is what you need to know:
On '/' you get an introduction to the site and a random number generated between 1 and 100.

On '/random/x' you can define a random number as big as you want (not really, but quite big though), where x is the maximum number that you can get.

This site was created following the simple tutorial on the Symfony Book about 'Page Creation' and used by me for learning a little bit more about routing. Anyway, hope you find it useful!
